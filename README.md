# Online Tetris
This project, using nodejs in backend and angularjs in frontend, is to create a online single/double player tetris game. It uses Rest API for user registration/authentication/logout, Web Socket (Socket.io) for real time communication (user create/join/leave a room, invite other players, read realtime other users' activities), and frontend framework to handle basic tetris game logic.
